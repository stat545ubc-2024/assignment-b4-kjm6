This repository contains all necessary files for the STAT545 B-4 Assignment. 

The assignment is contained in the files `assignment-b4.Rmd` and `assignment-b4.md`. In the assignment, there are three exercises. 

The first exercise shows the most commonly used non-filler words in the book Pride and Prejudice. 

The second exercise shows code for use as a new "language" of pig latin called duck latin. The function to translate english to duck latin is stored under the `R` folder in a document called `duck_latin.R`. This document contains the function and roxygen2 documentation for the function. 

The third exercise develops code and uses nesting and mapping functions to demonstrate a connection between tree size and east-west location in the City of Vancouver, and shows that the connection depends on tree genus.
