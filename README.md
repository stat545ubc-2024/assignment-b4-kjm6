This repository contains the Rmd and md files for the STAT545 B-4 Assignment. 

The assignment is contained in the files assignment-b4.Rmd and assignment-b4.md. In the assignment, there are three exercises. The first exercise shows the most commonly used non-filler words in the book Pride and Prejudice. The second exercise shows code for use as a new "language" of pig latin. The third exercise develops code and uses nesting and mapping functions to demonstrate a connection between tree size and location in the City of Vancouver, and shows that the connection depends on tree genus.
